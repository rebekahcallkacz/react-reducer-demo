# A Brief Intro to useReducer

This demo was adapted from [this code](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/the-road-to-learn-react/hacker-stories/tree/2021/React-Impossible-States?file=/src/App.js).

[This article](https://stately.ai/blog/usestate-vs-usereducer-vs-xstate-part-1-modals) shows the difference between using `useState` and `useReducer`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
